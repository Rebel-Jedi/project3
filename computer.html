    <h1>How to Build A PC</h1>
    <img src="media/pc.jpg" alt="psu">
    <h2>CPU</h2>
    <img src="media/cpu.jpg" alt="psu">
    <p>CPU is the central procesing unit. its the brain of the computer... blah blah blah im sure youve heard this before. The two most common manufacturers are AMD and Intel but basically, more gigafarts equals faster PC. Dont forget a CPU cooler for it bc things get toasty.(Yes its possible to cook food on a hot CPU but its not recommended.)</p>
    <h2>Motherboard</h2>
    <img src="media/mobo.jpg" alt="psu">
    <p>The motherboard is where most of the components are connected, it keeps everything together. It is reccomended to wear an anti-static wristband when handeling computer components but no one ever does you should be fine just ground yourself by touching some grass.(or touch a metal part of your case.) Static electricty isnt as big of a problem as it used to be you could honestly build your PC on a carpet and it might still work. Do that at your own risk theres a possibility you end up with an expensive paperweight.</p>
    <h2>RAM</h2>
    <img src="media/rammeme.jpg" alt="psu">
    <p>(dont actually download RAM)</p>
    <img src="media/ram.jpg" alt="psu">
    <p>Random access memory is temporary storage for your computer but its mostly taken up by google chrome. Typically more RAM will make your computer run more smoothly. Two things to look out for when buying memory is the speed and capacity. Similar to the PCU, a higher clock speed makes it faster. Today, you shouldnt be using anything less than 8GB of RAM but 16GB is strongly recommended. Additionally, make sure its compatible with your motherboard. Theres DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5 memory, your motherboard should say which one it supports. if it doesnt support any of these then its really old or your looking at a laptop.(this guide is for building a PC not a laptop)</p>
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <img src="media/disks.jpg" alt="psu">
    <p>There are to types of storage dives, solid state drives and hard disk drives. Hard drives contain spinning magnetic disks that contain all the 1s and 0s of the data stored on them. They are significantly slower than solid state drives. Solid state drives on the other hand are several times faster and use flash technology as opposed to magnetic disks. They are a little more expensive and I would not recommend installing your operating system on a hard drive. The image below perfectly describes SSDs vs HDDs.</p>

    <h2>PSU</h2>
    <img src="media/psu.jpg" alt="psu">
    <p>The power supply unit delivers power to the motherboard, CPU, and sata drives. Most desktop PSUs are an ATX form factor whcih is the standard. The wattage of a power supply determines how muhc power can be supplied. Higher end systems require a higher wattage and as a result, cost more. They have various efficiency ratings ranging from bronze to platinum. The higher the rating, the less energy is lost when converting from ac to dc. </p>
    <h3>once you have all the components just connect them together(they should connect like legos)</h3>
    <p>yeah you could put these components in a case but they will still work without a case just throw them in a cardboard box or something.</p>
    <p><strong>This is an example of what NOT to do</strong></p>
